# Project Novi

This project, created way back in 2014, is the software running on some touchscreens
located on the ground floor of the T-building of Windesheim University of Applied Sciences.

It was created as a school project with the aim of providing guests in the building a pleasant,
welcome experience. The screens (and this software) has since not been updated, so a lot of systems
no longer work (like the "Vertrektijden" screen, as NS has discontinued the API version we're using).

## Features

- Friendly homescreen with idle logic (return to home screen, say hi every now and then)
- Touch-friendly UI allowing the user to pick 'apps'
- Virtual assistant (very basic), using Google TTS to relay audio messages
  - Recordings are cached; so it works on existing screens, but the Google API has been locked down.
- RSS feed display
- Weather forecast (ðŸš§ broken)
- Train departure information (ðŸš§ broken)
- Twitter feed (ðŸš§ broken)
- Map of the building, with instructions (out of date, but functional)
- Extensive documentation

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository
2. Launch the repository in Visual Studio
3. Build the application
